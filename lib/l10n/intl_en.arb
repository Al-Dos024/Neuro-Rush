    "Introduction_title": "Introduction",
    "Introduction_subtitle": "ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that starts in childhood and affects around 5% of the global population. Children with ADHD may struggle to follow instructions, control their actions, and integrate into school environments, leading to academic performance issues. Managing children with ADHD can be challenging for parents and teachers. It`s important to provide children with love, support, and understanding, and to work with healthcare professionals and teachers to learn how to handle the child best.",

    "Symptoms_title": "Symptoms",
    "Symptoms_subtitle": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The symptoms are challenging to define. They must be observed for at least six months in two different settings to diagnose ADHD.  When the symptoms are categorized in children, three subtypes emerge: predominantly inattention, predominantly hyperactivity-impulsivity, and combined inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Most people exhibit some of these behaviors, but not to the point where they significantly interfere with their work, relationships, or studies. Symptoms may persist into adulthood, but diagnosing ADHD in adults remains a clinical diagnosis. Symptoms may differ from childhood to adolescence due to adaptations and avoidance mechanisms acquired during socialization.",

    "Reasons_title": "Reasons",
    "Reasons_subtitle": "There is no single cause for ADHD. However, there are a number of factors that may contribute to or worsen it, including genetics, diet, and physical and social environments.\n",

    "Genetic_factors_title": "Genetic factors",
    "Genetic_factors_subtitle": "ADHD is thought to be mainly hereditary, with genetic factors contributing to about 75% of cases. Several genes, including those affecting dopamine transporters, are believed to play a role in the disorder. ADHD is considered to be a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. One theory suggests that hyperactivity was an adaptive trait in early humans, with individuals with ADHD being more effective at tasks involving risk or competition in certain ancient societies.\n",

    "Environmental_factors_title": "Environmental factors",
    "Environmental_factors_subtitle": "Environmental factors play a significant role in ADHD development. Factors such as alcohol and tobacco exposure during pregnancy, lead exposure, premature birth, and infectious diseases increase the risk. Studies have linked the pesticide chlorpyrifos to ADHD symptoms in children. Higher pesticide exposure correlates with a 35% increased risk of ADHD, and even low levels of exposure can have an impact.\n",

    "Dietary_systems_title": "Dietary systems",
    "Dietary_systems_subtitle": "A study by the University of Southampton linked children`s consumption of certain artificial colors with hyperactivity, prompting action by the British government and the European Commission. In the United States, federal law requires food manufacturers to disclose the use of artificial colors on product packaging. This allows consumers to make informed choices about the products they purchase. The findings highlight the importance of continued vigilance in regulating artificial colors in food.\n",

    "Pathophysiology_title": "Pathophysiology",
    "Pathophysiology_subtitle_one": "The pathophysiology of ADHD is complex and unclear. Research shows reduced brain volume in children with ADHD, particularly in the left prefrontal cortex, suggesting dysfunction in the frontal lobe.",
    "Pathophysiology_subtitle_two": "Neuroimaging studies are now only used for research purposes, not for diagnosis. A 2005 review identified four interconnected frontal brain regions implicated in ADHD: the lateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the caudate nucleus, and the cortex.",
